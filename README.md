## üí° What is a String?

- Single Quote 'Hellow World'
- Double Quote "Hello World!"
- Triple Quote ''' This is your Second Assignment'''
## üõ†Ô∏è String-Operations
string operations are action performed on sequence of characters (string) in programming, including cancatination, substringing, comparison, case conversion, finding length and finding specific character or sub strings.
Here are some **common string operation**s:
### Cancatination
Joining two or more srings together to form a single, longer string. You can join two or more strings using ' + ' operator.
### Substring
Extracting a portion of a string from it.
### Length
Determining the number of character from string by using the len(). It counts all number, spaces, character and symbols.
### Repetition
Repetition means saying the same thing again and again. Repeat a string multiple times using the * operators.
### Indexing 
Strings are like list of characters. You can get any letter using its index starting from 0. Think of it like picking a word by its position.
### Slicing(Getting Part of string)
You can get any part of string by using [start:end]
### Changing Cases
Use methods like .upper(),.lower() and .title() to change letter cases. It is used for formating text nicely.
### Stripping(Removing Extra spaces)
In string, .strip() method used to remove extra spaces from beginning and end.
### Replacing
In string, .replace() method used to replace specific part of word or letter.
### Checking Substring
Use in to check one string is inside another. It is very helpful to search in text.
### Spiliting and Joining
- .spilit() method used to breat the string into list.
- .join() method used to join the string together.
### String Formating
We can add values into strings f-string or .format().

Whether you're just starting career as passionate programmer or looking to sharpend your skills, this series provide structured, hands on learning through **Jupyter Notebook** covering different topics.
## 💡 What is a String?
Strings are sequence of numbers, letters, symbols and spaces enclosed into single, double or triple quotes. Strings are ordered collection, immutable once created it cannot be changed, strings are primarily used to strore and manupulate textual data.
- Single Quote 'Hellow World'
- Double Quote "Hello World!"
- Triple Quote ''' This is your Second Assignment'''
## 🛠️ String-Operations
string operations are action performed on sequence of characters (string) in programming, including cancatination, substringing, comparison, case conversion, finding length and finding specific character or sub strings.
Here are some **common string operation**s:
### 1.Cancatination
Joining two or more srings together to form a single, longer string. You can join two or more strings using ' + ' operator.
### 2.Substring
Extracting a portion of a string from it.
### 3.Length
Determining the number of character from string by using the len(). It counts all number, spaces, character and symbols.
### 4.Repetition
Repetition means saying the same thing again and again. Repeat a string multiple times using the * operators.
### 5.Indexing 
Strings are like list of characters. You can get any letter using its index starting from 0. Think of it like picking a word by its position.
### 6.Slicing(Getting Part of string)
You can get any part of string by using [start:end]
### 7.Changing Cases
Use methods like .upper(),.lower() and .title() to change letter cases. It is used for formating text nicely.
### 8.Stripping(Removing Extra spaces)
In string, .strip() method used to remove extra spaces from beginning and end.
### 9.Replacing
In string, .replace() method used to replace specific part of word or letter.
### 10.Checking Substring
Use in to check one string is inside another. It is very helpful to search in text.
### 11.Spiliting and Joining
- .spilit() method used to breat the string into list.
- .join() method used to join the string together.
### 12.String Formating
We can add values into strings f-string or .format().
## 🧑‍💻 What is User Input?
  Let's talk about user input in very easy way. 
  User input means getting information from the user using the program. We use the input() function to do this in python.
                                        age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
                                                    print(age + 5)
## 🧮 What are operators ?
Operators are symbols or special words that are used to perform operatios on variable or values.
                                        a = 5
                                        b = 3
                              print(a + b)  # Output: 8

### Common Types of Operators:
**1. Arithmetic Operators**
          Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematic operations.
| operator | Description    | Example     |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| +        | Addition      | 3 + 1 = 4   |
| -        | Subtraction   | 2 - 1 = 1   |
| *        | Multiplication| 4 * 2 = 8   |
| /        | Division      | 8 / 2 = 4   |
| %        | Modulus       | 5 % 2 = 1   |
| **       | Exponentation | 2 ** 3 = 8  |

            | operator | Description      | Example    |
          |------------|-------------     |---------   |
          |    +       |  Addition        |3 + 1 = 4   |
          |    -       | Substraction     | 2-1  = 1   |
          |    *       | Multiplication   | 4 * 2 = 1  |
          |    /       | Division         | 8 /2 = 4   |
          |    %       | Modulus          | 5 % 2 = 1  |
          |    **      | Exponentation    | 2 ** 3 = 8 |

**2.Comparison operators**
          Comparison operators are used to compare two values.
           | operator | Description | Example |
           |----------|-------------|---------|
          |    ==    |  Equal to   | 5 == 5 |
          |    !=     | Not Equal to| 5 != 5 |
          |    >     | Greater than| 4 > 2 |
          |    <    | Less than   |  2 < 4|
          |    >=     | Greater or Equal   | 6 >= 6 |
          |    <=   | Less or Equal | 3 <= 5|
